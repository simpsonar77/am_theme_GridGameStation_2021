This theme is slight modified from GridGameStation created by kent79: http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=898.0
That theme seemed to have been largely abandoned, but was quite a decent grid view for attract mode.

Changes/Fixes:
* fixed backgroun image display
* Added rows/cols entry option (before they were somewhat hardcoded based on whether it was widescreen/crt/etc...)
* Incorporated fixes for navigation clicks

Todo:  change background colors, add startup splash screen/video?

* maybe add System art to the top instead of the basic text there now.  i.e. system logos, etc...
